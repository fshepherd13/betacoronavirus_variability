This phylogeny shows betacoronavirus spike (beta-CoV) diversity sampled from [Genbank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/?term=betacoronavirus+NOT+%22SARS-CoV-2%22+20000%3A99999%5BSLEN%5D). 

Only strains containing both the spike and nucleocapsid open reading frame were kept, and sequences were trimmed to the N open reading frame for this analysis. Metadata was retrieved by downloading the metadata from [VIPR](https://www.viprbrc.org/brc/vipr_genome_search.spg?method=ShowCleanSearch&decorator=corona), excluding Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, and merged to the sequence names based on the Genbank accession number (the .gb file format was needed to trim ORFs based on CDS annotations in Genbank metadata, which is why two separate files needed to be downloaded and merged).
